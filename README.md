# Commercial Detector

This repository focuses on need or use case and working of automated system through which one could detect the commercial in a TV program. This detection would be based upon both feature and recognition methods. Feature based method includes various features of commercial like increase in audio amplitude, silent frame, aspect ratio, black frame, etc. Recognition based method includes comparing of data with stored features of commercial, such as logo. Proposed system combines both feature based parameter such as aspect ratio for commercial block detection and recognition based parameter such as stored logo for individual commercial detection.
This system would be of great interest to the advertisers where they can use the information of live broadcast of their Ads to take some business actions.
